I made this originally, this is just a fork that is newer and has pywal support ish if you use it with my dotfiles.

Live at https://calc.tobira.io

Wanna do the big funny haha pywal?

1. Self host this with nginx
2. Get the startpage script from my [dotfiles](https://github.com/thatonecalculator/bspwm-dotfiles)
3. Go into your server or whatever and clone this in `/var/www/html/`
4. Set up the startpage script from the dotfiles
5. Go to `your-servers-url.com/wal.html` and be amazed.
